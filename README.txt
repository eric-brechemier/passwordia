Passwordia

DESCRIPTION
  Passwordia is a family of typefaces designed to provide an alternate
  treatment for passwords: instead of replacing all characters with an
  asterisk or a small circle, all characters get displayed using the same
  glyph when the font family is set to Passwordia.

  This allows to drag and drop or copy and paste a password while protecting
  its text from prying eyes.

  I designed this typeface to enhance the user experience with the password
  generator "Enlarge Your Password" [1], after looking for an existing font
  with a single glyph [2], without success.
